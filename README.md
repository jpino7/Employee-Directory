# Employee Directory

## Description
Creating an employee directory with React. This project required me to break up my app's UI into components, manage components state, and respond to user events. This project has a table with user data being pulled from ` https://randomuser.me/api/?results=200&nat=us ` API, with a form where you can search by name, phone number, or email, and the NAME heading on the table can be filtered by ascending or descending via First Name.
